# Item Catalog Project
I implemented it following along with the lessons of  Full Stack Foundations and Authentication and Authorization courses after fully understanding it. It implements the CRUD functionality which enables users to create, edit, delete and view restaurants and menu items in them after being signed in with google account. No user can edit items or add new items in other users' restaurants.

# Installation

To run that code you need to have to have vagrant installed and the udacity VM installed,
then go to vagrant subfolder in that VM and run vagrant up, after it finishes run vagrant ssh.

# Usage

After the previous step, go to shared directory cd /vagrant where yo should have folder project catalog in then go to `cd /catalog`, then run in shell `python project.py` and press enter that will run the application on `http://localhost:5000`
